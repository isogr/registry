  name: ITRF96 to NZGD2000 [LINZ v20171201]
  operationVersion: LINZ v20171201
  parameters: []
  remarks: Uses LINZ NZGD2000 deformation model. The deformation model transforms
    an ITRF96 coordinate at a specified epoch to NZGD2000. NZGD2000 is equivalent
    to ITRF96 epoch 2000 in areas unaffected by earthquakes and other localised deformation.
    The files required for this version of the transformation are contained within
    the most recent published version of the deformation model, if a more recent version
    than this one exists. The nominal operation accuracy is 0.02m horizontally and
    vertically, which represents the expected consistency of NZGD2000 coordinates
    calculated at different epochs, in the absence of significant local deformation.
