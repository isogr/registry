  remarks: Transformation identical with ITRF2008 to ITRF2014 due to IGb08 being aligned
    to ITRF2008 and IGS14 being aligned to ITRF2014. Accuracy of transformation is
    given at the reference epoch for the transformation parameters. Accuracy at other
    epochs depends on the accuracies of the parameters at the reference epoch and
    their rates of change. Refer to citations for accuracies of the parameters and
    their rates of change.
