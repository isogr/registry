  <p>
    The ISO Geodetic Registry is a structured database of coordinate reference systems (CRS) and transformations that is accessible through this online registry system.
    The Register includes only systems and transformations of international application.
    It does not include all possible coordinate reference systems and transformations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Registry is provided under the auspices of
    <a href="https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211" target="_blank" title="ISO Technical Committee 211">ISO Technical Committee 211</a>
    on geographic information/geomatics and conforms to the following ISO standards:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211" target="_blank" title="ISO 19111:2007">ISO 19111:2007</a> (Spatial referencing by coordinates)</li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    Work is also underway to upgrade the Registry to conform to the recently revised ISO 19111:2019 standard, which includes support for dynamic datums and geoid-based datums.

  <p>
    <b>July 2022</b>: ISO/TC 211, OGC and IOGP have jointly published the
    "<a href="https://committee.iso.org/files/live/sites/tc211/files/Resources/GuideToCRSRegistries3.pdf">Guide to Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Resources</a>".
    The guide describes basic information and the intended purposes of the three authoritative
    CRS registers: EPSG, ISO Geodetic and OGC CRS registries, for the user community.

  <h3>Register system update</h3>

  <p>

  The ISOGR has been updated to a new register system based on the Paneron
  platform created by Ribose, Inc. In addition to a completely new and more
  efficient user interface, geographic extents for items have been moved into a
  new extents item class. Each extent has now been assigned a name and ISOGR
  identifier code.

  </p>

  <ul>

  <li>The main section of the web page uses tabs to display both lists of items
  in a class and items themselves. Whenever a class or item is opened, a new tab
  will appear on the tab bar at the top of the main section of the web page.

  <li>Item classes are listed in the “Browse” sidebar at the top-left of the web
  page.

  <li>A right-arrow (&gt;) to the left of a class name indicates it has
  sub-classes. Click on the arrow icon or double-click the class name to list
  the sub-classes (the right-arrow turns into a down-arrow). Click on the
  down-arrow to close the list of sub-classes.

  <li>Double-click on an item class to list all of it’s items in a new tab in
  the main section of the web page.

  <li>Double-click a class item in the main section of the web page to display
  the information for that item in a new tab.

  <li>To close a tab, click on the X at the end of the tab name.

  <li>The ISOGR home page is always accessible by selecting the Home tab at the
  left end of the tab bar. The Home tab is always present and cannot be closed.

  <li>A simple “Quick search” function is provided at the top of the main
  section of the web page when displaying the home page or a list of class
  items. Entering search text will display in real-time a list of items with the
  search text in their name or aliases.

  <li>To copy a link to the complete current view of the ISOGR web page with all
  open tabs, click on “Copy link to this view” on bottom-left of the web page.

  <li>To reset the current view of the ISOGR web page, click on “Reset
  interface” at the bottom-right of the web page. [Need to explain exactly what
  this action does. It does not appear to do anything when I click on it.]
