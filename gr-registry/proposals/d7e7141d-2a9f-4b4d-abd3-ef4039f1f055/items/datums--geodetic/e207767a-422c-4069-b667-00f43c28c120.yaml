    Defined through coordinates and observations used to derive the previous
    AGD66 coordinates with the addition of point-position and multi-station
    Doppler, SLR and VLBI observations. The final coordinates were obtained from
    a single national least squares adjustment of all observations holding the
    coordinate of the Johnston Origin fixed.
