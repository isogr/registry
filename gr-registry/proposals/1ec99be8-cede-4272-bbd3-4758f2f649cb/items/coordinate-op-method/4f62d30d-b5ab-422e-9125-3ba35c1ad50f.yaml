  remarks: >-
    Transformation method between different static NAD83(CSRS) realizations
    (datums) at different fixed coordinate reference epochs (defined in each
    datum entry) using an NRCan velocity grid to account for crustal motions
    between epochs, which represent the primary differences between such
    realizations. Residual differences are due to the use of more data and
    improved adjustment methodologies in successive realizations, which are
    considered insignificant for practical purposes and quantified by the
    specific transformation accuracies. The transformation involves
    interpolation of the specified velocity grid using ellipsoidal coordinates
    in the interpolation CRS to obtain the predicted velocities in mm/yr in
    north, east and up. See formula citation for description of grid format. No
    official reference is provided by NRCan for the transformation formula. See
    instead the description in EPSG Geomatics Guidance Note Number 7, part 2.
    Method is reversible to any practical accuracy level (better than 0.001
    mm/yr).
