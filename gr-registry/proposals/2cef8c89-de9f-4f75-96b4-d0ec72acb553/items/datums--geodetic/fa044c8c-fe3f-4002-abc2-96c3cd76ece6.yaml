  name: IGS20
  originDescription: >-
    Derived from a long-term combination of daily IGS repro3 solutions from 1994
    to 2020 and aligned in origin, scale and orientation and their rates of
    change to ITRF2020 at epoch 2015.0 via a subset of 332 stable, well
    performing IGS stations.

  releaseDate: '2022-11-27'
  remarks: >-
    Replaces IGb14. Used by IGS products from 2022-11-27. An updated set of
    satellite and ground antenna calibrations defined in igs20.atx and
    post-seismic deformation models defined in psd_IGS20.snx must be used
    together with IGS20. IGS20 is expected to be updated annually as new
    ITRF2020 updates are produced. The updates are named IGx20, where x is a
    lower case letter representing each update. Each update is aligned to
    ITRF2020 using a set of well performing ITRF stations from the corresponding
    ITRF update, For all practical purposes IGS20 and its updates are considered
    be coincident with ITRF2020 and its updates. *** IGb20 is the first update
    to IGS20 and is used for IGS products from GPS week 2352 (2025-02- 02). It
    is based on a subset of 343 well performing IGS stations from the
    ITRF2020-u2023 update, including 11 new stations mainly in areas with
    previously sparse coverage.
