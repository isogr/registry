      name: NZGD2000 Deformation Model
      parameters:
      - 1df0907d-ac5b-4263-8d90-18d0f3c0d19c
      remarks: This model provides the relationship between a global reference frame
        (ie one of the ITRFs) and the local reference frame (NZGD2000). It includes
        both functional definitions and spatial representations for a range of geophysical
        deformation sources that are represented as discrete sub-models. Each sub-model
        may include both horizontal and vertical deformation elements, as well as
        uncertainties.  A sub-model is built of one or more components (such as co-seismic
        and post-seismic components) that when added together give the total deformation
        for that event. Each component consists of a time function and a spatial representation.
        The time function defines how a time-based scale factor gets applied to each
        deformation element.
